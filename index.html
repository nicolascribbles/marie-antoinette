  <h3> Introduction</h3>
<p>French history has been a scandalous and bloody one. Some of the greatest atrocities began with the 10-year conflict of the French Revolution. The French Revolution had political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual changes; it was an event one should study with great depth to discover how it began and who was involved before it happened. Prior to the French Revolution, a strong monarchy with family ties to the creation of the Palace of Versailles and countless heroic military victories ruled France. The ruling family of Augusté is important because they also funded much of the successful American Revolution to be spiteful of the British using taxes. In addition, Queen Marie Antoinette’s lavish taste was funded by the same taxes. Why did the French public refer to Marie Antoinette as “Madame Deficit”? They believed she was at the root of growing deficit and heavy tax burden on the Third Estate. Marie Antoinette was innocent of the claims that killed her because she was ill-prepared for politics and economics, she was blissfully ignorant, and sabotaged by other nobles. It is important to recognize who the Queen was to understand if these accusations were accurate in this analytical quest to discover the last Queen of France.</p>
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna, on November 2nd of 1755, in Austria to the Habsburg family, she was one of Maria Theresa’s 16 children . By the time she was 10, she had been married off to mend the rivalry between Austria and France. King Louis XV wanted to educate the child and sent tutor Abbé de Vermond to Vienna in 1768 when Marie Antoinette was only 13. She could barely read or write in her native German, which meant she was no good at French either, and was described as easily distracted. Abbé de Vermond reported she was “rather lazy and extremely frivolous, she is hard to teach”.   As an innocent child brought into French royalty, the dreams of Versailles perhaps created fairy-tale like delusions for Marie Antoinette. Daydreams of comfort and popularity of being the young, beautiful new sweetheart face was almost fitting to the illusion that it was prophecy for her to fulfill her duties in the French kingdom. This was her chance to be a storybook princess with unlimited riches; keeping up appearances was necessary as all eyes were always on her. This evidence suggests that Marie Antoinette did not care about learning any academics but truly enjoyed being around other people. Marie Antoinette was a heavy supporter of absolutist monarchies, making her a conservative. This did not make her heartless; she took in an orphaned boy and saw to it that he was provided an education, and another recollection of her tenderness was shown when helping a peasant injured by a stag.  She “was so happy at doing good and hated to miss any opportunity of doing so,” wrote Madame Campan, the First Lady of the Bedchamber. The softhearted queen longed more for tenderness than she did for power. 
Marie Antoinette spent her time winning the hearts of the aristocratic families, playing music, displaying her charm, and winning over the heart of King Louis XV before his death four years after her marriage to his grandson, Louis XVI. His death left behind a country of many problems to 19-year-old King Louis XVI who was inadequately prepared to solve the issues presented, such as rising taxes on the poor and the lack of food. France had to come up with ways to prove its militaristic might to the rest of the world and with the grace of his advisors, King Louis XVI decided to help fund the American War of Independence to spite the British, France’s biggest rival, who controlled American territory . The money had to come from somewhere, so it was tacked on to the heavy taxes the French already had to pay. These passages highlight how neither the King or Queen were properly educated about politics or economics.</div>
<h3>Ignorance Is Bliss</h3>
<p>Marie Antoinette’s innocence heavily relies on her ignorance. It was rumored that even Marie Antoinette’s mother, Austrian Empress Maria Theresa, had a spy which allowed her to criticize and counsel her daughter from afar. As a French Queen, keeping up appearances for Marie Antoinette was an important aspect. This was no problem for her because of her undeniable love for fashion. She was a young girl with a credit card that had no limits, figuratively speaking, and the world was at her fingertips. She loved gambling, the latest fashions, music and parties. Before her head rolled, the good times did. This frivolity was a sign of her blissful ignorance to the brewing revolution. Unfortunately for the young queen, upholding the fashion expectations will prove to be difficult, as she was heavily judged for her spending habits, and yet again scorned by her mother.  Although she symbolized peace between the two nations of France and Austria, pornographic propaganda and liberal nationalism led to her reputation as “Madame Déficit”, the most hated woman in France. From the start of her life at Versailles, the expectations were high and the rules were complicated.  People were prepared to watch the King and Queen consummate, and when they were unable to provide a show, the French public quickly turned on Marie Antoinette’s inadequacy as a wife . When she arrived at the French Border, she was stripped entirely of all Austrian fabrics and jewelry, including her name, with a French crowd of nobles to witness. She was given the name of Marie Antoinette, adorned with French jewelry, and given French gowns .  This moment symbolized her abandonment of Austrian loyalties and declaration of the adoption of prioritizing French allegiance. Naturally, to other nationalistic French people, she was still an outsider. Some historians speculate that her affianced held no interests in her.
This encouraged her to live an aloof life despite giving up any rights to a private life. With expectations to provide a male heir for the throne and the inability to spark interest into her husband, she turned to having parties that lasted all night, drinking and eating delicious pastries, drowning in new dresses and setting new trends. King Louis XVI provided her with an escape house he called “Le Petit Trianon”, where Marie Antoinette held her private parties to live her life of blissful ignorance. The French media slandered the queen by quoting her most famous line, "let them eat cake" after being addressed about her hungry people (although this is not actually on record), this kind of propaganda would not play out well for this Austrian beauty. Some saw this as a threat and began to ask Marie Antoinette to address the rumors, however Marie Antoinette’s choice of action was to ignore the rumors because they were false to begin with , and because she copes with her problems with blissful ignorance.</p>
<h3>The Queen's Sex Life</h3>
<p>With rising tensions regarding the hungry poor and the Queen's indifference to their pleas and growing tensions among the nobles she did not allow to attend her parties, she made many enemies. The first wave of propaganda regarding Marie Antoinette's sexuality began because of the inability to consummate their marriage. This was largely known because French royalty sex was a public affair. She lived in constant anxiety fearing her husband would never love her and that she would be sent back to Austria, and it didn’t help that her mother told her things like “lavish more caresses” on her husband, reminding Marie Antoinette that her fears could become a reality. Some claimed she was an Austrian spy, some claimed she was in a lesbian relationship with Pricesse de Lamballe, which may have been a large contributor to her gruesome death. When she was killed during the September massacres of 1792, the murdering mob carried her head on a pike and demanded the queen to “kiss the lips of her intimate”, meaning they truly believed the propaganda . The same way news spread about Marie Antoinette’s inability to woo her own husband, news also spread about the King’s impotence, and with that message came the claim that if he was inadequate in the bedroom, he must be inadequate as a leader. This propaganda spread throughout the streets of Paris. By the end of her reign alongside King Louis XVI, she had a brutal conclusion to her extravagant, short life . Despite outliving several brothers and sisters in age, her death unleashed an apocalyptic reality in the beautiful nation of France with The Reign of Terror and Maximilien de Robespierre at the head . The indication that she did not see this coming proves she was blissfully ignorant to the problems that she was facing and blissful ignorance was her coping mechanism. </p>
<h3>Propaganda, A prostitute, forgery, and a diamond necklace</h3><p>
Marie Antoinette had atrocious propaganda released, fabricated to depict her having many lovers in exchange for materialistic items. Ignorance and stupidity were not the only things to send Marie Antoinette to her grave. What put the nail in the coffin was a famous story about a diamond necklace that tarnished her name even further . This scandal revolved around jaw-dropping diamonds, a prostitute, and forgery. Marie Antoinette was sabotaged by Comtesse de Lamotte and her lover, Rétaux de Vilette. It started with a pair of jewelers named Böhmer & Bassenge who nearly became bankrupt creating a necklace they assumed King Louis XV would buy for his mistress, Madame du Barry. This piece was an incredibly large necklace, weighing in at 2,800 carats. They had hoped they could procure 1.6 million livres (an equivalent to 100 million US dollars today). Adorned with glittering loops, pendants, ribbons and knotted tassels descending from a choker of 17 graduated gems. Unfortunately for Madame du Barry, King Louis XV passed, leaving the jewelers under massive debt and Madame du Barry’s neck bare. They were heavily influenced to attempt to make the sale to King Louis XVI, in hopes that Her Majesty would fancy the necklace. Though King Louis XVI wanted to buy her the necklace, Marie Antoinette refused in a nationalistic attempt to mind her expenses, suggesting the money would be better spent on France’s navy .</p><p>
This necklace remained in the hands of the jewelers until a Comtesse by the name of Jeanne de Lamotte Valois formed a plot to get out of debt by acquiring the necklace through any means necessary and selling the gems. The Comtesse approached the unpopular Cardinal de Rohan, knowing he wished for Marie Antoinette’s validation, and talked about this beautiful necklace Marie Antoinette desperately wished for but was afraid to ask King Louis XVI to buy it for her. Jeanne de Lamotte suggested that if he could find a way to get the necklace, his good reputation would be regained at court. Lamotte then had Rétaux de Vilette, her lover, forge letters in Marie Antoinette’s handwriting pleading with the Cardinal to purchase the necklace and even hired a prostitute to pose as Marie Antoinette to meet with the cardinal in the Versailles garden. This convinced the cardinal to purchase the necklace from Böhmer & Bassenge on credit.  The necklace was presented to queen’s footman, who was actually Rétaux in disguise, he collected the necklace, and fled to London .</p><p>
When it came time to make the first payment, the cardinal could not afford it, so the jewelers demanded payment from the queen herself, who had no clue this necklace had been purchased. This infuriated the King and he had the cardinal arrested who was later acquitted and exiled from France during trial. Comtesse de Lamotte was also imprisoned but she broke free and moved to England. Most importantly, when the cardinal testified, he told what he believed to be true which was Marie Antoinette had approached him about the necklace . This evidence demonstrates Marie Antoinette was sabotaged by other jealous nobles.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>
Marie’s decapitation was a recipe made up of ingredients such as ignorance, frivolity, and betrayal. There was nothing she could have done that would have stopped this event from unfolding because it had been brewing since before King Louis XVI. Many of the choices made were due to incompetent advisors. Some historians ponder if her downfall began the day she was betrothed to Louis XVI. What many historians know is that in exploring the analytical quest the last queen of France, they find that she was innocent on the account of being very stupid, tragically.</p>
